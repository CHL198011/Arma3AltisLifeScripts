# Arma-3-RedRaw-Scripts
The part of redraw gaming's server that I actually developed for...

Trucking scripts, is part of a system developed to work exclusively with the RR framwork developed by the RedRaw team. So it would be possible for you to integrate but like don't bother right your own.

fn_actualFuel should work well on any Arma 3 server, I don't remember it being very RedRaw specific.

fn_ANPR.sqf is an ANPR script that just kinda works, obviously you want to integrate it with whatever you are building for, i.e. KeyHandler etc...

fn_getIn.sqf is just an event handler that goes with actual fuel so it works. You'd need to include this as an event to be handled by Arma.
